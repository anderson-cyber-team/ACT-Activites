# ACT Activities
This repository will house the activities that apply what they learned about certain cybersecurity topics. It will also include a list of resources students will need when participating in the activity

## Vocabulary
* Plaintext => Unencrypted Readable text
* Ciphertext => Text that has been changed in some way using an algorithm
* Encryption => The process of changing text into unreadable ciphertext
* Decryption => The process of changing ciphertext into readable plaintext

## Crpytography


## Password Cracking
In this activity, imagine you are a hacker and you want to access Professor Burch's personal information. Through some intense snooping, you found five MD5 hashes that get used repeatedly. Using Hashcat and CUPP, you will generate a wordlist of potential passwords using his PowerPoint bio as a reference. Then, using hashcat, you will crack each of the hashes. This exercise aims to help you understand what cryptography is and how it can be practically applied.
