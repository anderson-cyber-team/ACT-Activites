# ACT Activites
This repository will house the activites can apply what they learned about certain cybersecurity topics. It will also include a list of resources students will need when participating in the activity

## Cryptography
In this activity, imagine you are a hacker and you are trying to gain access to Professor Burch's personal information. Through some intense snooping, you found 5, MD5 hashes, that get used repeatdely. Using Hashcat and CUPP, you will generate a wordlist of potential passwords using his powerpoint bio as reference. Then using hashcat you will crack each of the hashes. The purpose of this excercise is to help you understand (Micahel can fill this in)

### Resources Required
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Kali Linux (Ask an ACT Cabinet member for assistance)
* CUPP
* Hashcat (Comes pre-installed with Linux)

#### How to install CUPP

1.) Make sure your current working directory is Desktop
```sh
pwd
cd Desktop
```
2.) Navigate to desktop using cd and using mkdir to create a CUPP folder and navigate into it
```sh
mkdir CUPP
cd CUPP
```
3.) Clone the Cupp repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git
cd cupp
```
4.) Run the CUPP interface
```sh
python3 cupp.py
```
5.) Will input information as instructed on CUPP interface

#### How to Use Hashcat
1.) While in the cupp directory create a file called md5.txt, you can use ls to make sure it was made
```sh
touch md5.txt
```
2.) Use the nano text editor to open the file
```sh
nano md5.txt
```
3.) In this file you will input a hash and then press Ctrl+s and Crtl+x

4.) To run hashcat use this, the burchPasswordWordList.txt is the file generated from CUPP
```sh
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 md5.txt burchPasswordWordlist.txt
```
